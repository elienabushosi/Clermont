# Lindero — Home Page (Dashboard)

## Goal

The Home page is the first screen after login. Its goal is to display a feed of new client activity and help architects quickly prioritize who to review and follow up with.

## What the Home Page Displays (Activity Feed)

The feed should surface the following items:

### 1) New prospects (lead form submissions)

Lead forms include:

-   Name
-   Email
-   Property address
-   Goals (development, redesign, questions)

### 2) Great-fit clients

Clients who appear to be a great fit based on the data they provided.

### 3) Feasibility reports ready

Feasibility reports that are complete and ready for the architect to review.

### 4) Likely-to-close clients

Clients who show strong signals they are likely to convert into a signed project.

### 5) Incomplete submissions

Clients who did not provide enough information to generate a meaningful feasibility snapshot.

### 6) AI priority suggestions

AI suggestions that identify which clients should be treated as high priority (and why).

## Notes

-   The Home page is meant for quick triage and prioritization, not deep analysis.
-   Detailed feasibility and zoning views should live in dedicated report or client pages.
